It contains applicable code lines and sample data set from the book chapter published in Artificial Intelligence in Prescriptive Analytics: Innovations in Decision Analysis, Optimization, and Data-driven Decisions (AIPA-24).
This study illustrates the successful prediction of hourly air pollutant concentrations in a specific region through the application of machine learning algorithms. Real-time pollutant and meteorological data—including air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and air pressure—collected via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were effectively utilized to develop the short-term forecasting model. Various machine learning regression algorithms, such as random forest, decision tree, support vector, k-nearest neighbor, and multilayer perceptron regression, formed the foundation of this predictive model. These findings contribute to the development of robust strategies for mitigating air pollution and represent a significant advancement in adopting a more proactive and anticipatory approach to managing air quality issues.
